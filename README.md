# bitwala-task

Bitwala coding challenge: A React Native app that will display bitcoin latest blocks and transactions

## Dependencies

- Bitquery GraphQL API

## Decision documentation

### Using Expo

I decided to use Expo to get started. Expo has limitations of course, however, the requirements of the app at the moment can perfectly be built with Expo. Once we'll add requirements that Expo doesn't support, we can easily "eject".
I've made good experiences with using tools like Expo or create-react-app to get started, as it does a lot of the heavy-lifting regarding configuration and many best practises are already implemented.

## Things to consider for the future

- Support multiple languages
